# Passwords Done Easy
Simple Beginner-Oriented Password Generator written in NextJS using ShadCN, Tailwind and TypeScript.

## But why?
One of the first Web projects I ever made was a simple HTML+CSS+JS Password Generator hosted on GitHub pages.
I've also recreated the same project multiple times, and this is the latest iteration of that process. (Generation #3)
It is a massive improvement, prioritizing keeping a easy and intuitive Interface that any beginner can understand.
